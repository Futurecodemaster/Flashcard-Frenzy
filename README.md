# Flashcard-Frenzy



This code is a flashcard learning program written in Python using the Tkinter library. It uses a CSV file to store pairs of English and French words. The program loads the word pairs from the file and presents a random word pair to the user in French. After a few seconds, the English translation of the word is shown. The user can then indicate if they know the word by clicking the "check" button or if they don't know the word by clicking the "cross" button. If the user knows the word, the word pair is removed from the word list. The word list is saved back to the CSV file, and a new random word pair is presented. The Tkinter library is used to create the GUI of the program, including the canvas where the flashcard is displayed, the buttons to indicate if the user knows the word or not, and the window that contains the canvas and buttons.
